# SEO-OPTIMIZER-SHOPIFY-APP
An app that audits product pages and suggests AI-generated improvements for titles, metafields, images, resizing etc


## **MVP Implementation Scope**

- **Highlight issues and suggestions on a dashboard and/or inline.**
- **Allow one-click acceptance of AI-powered fixes, with instant updates to the store.**
- **Support both individual and bulk actions.**

## Delivery Visualization:

- **Step 1:** User runs a scan or audit of their store/page.
- **Step 2:** The app presents a list (and/or visual highlights) of issues with AI-powered recommendations for each.
- **Step 3:** The user can:
    - Review all suggestions on a dashboard.
    - Click on any highlighted element in context to see the suggestion.
    - Accept individual changes or select multiple and approve them in bulk.
- **Step 4:** The app pushes accepted changes directly to the Shopify store via the API.

### Path:

1. **User clicks “Scan Store”** in your app.
2. **App triggers a bulk operation** to fetch all relevant data (products, pages, etc.).
3. **Once the operation completes**, download and process the results.
4. **Display all findings and recommendations** in your app, with one-click/bulk apply options.
