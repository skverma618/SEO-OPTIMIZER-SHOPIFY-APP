# Quick Setup with Your ngrok URL

## Your ngrok URL: `https://9abf68da545c.ngrok-free.app`

## Next Steps to Test with Real Shopify:

### 1. Create Shopify Partner Account & App
1. Go to https://partners.shopify.com/
2. Create a Partner account (free)
3. Create a new app with these settings:
   - **App URL**: `https://9abf68da545c.ngrok-free.app`
   - **Allowed redirection URL**: `https://9abf68da545c.ngrok-free.app/api/auth/callback`

### 2. Get Real API Credentials
After creating the app, you'll get:
- Client ID (API Key)
- Client Secret

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Replace these values in `api/.env`:
```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_real_api_secret_here
CLIENT_ID=your_real_api_key_here
CLIENT_SECRET=your_real_api_secret_here
```

### 4. Create Development Store
1. In Partner Dashboard → Stores → Add store → Development store
2. Choose "Create a store to test and build"
3. Select "Start with test data" for sample products
4. Note your store domain (e.g., `your-store-name.myshopify.com`)

### 5. Test the Connection
1. Make sure ngrok is running: `ngrok http 3001`
2. Make sure your API server is running on port 3001
3. Go to `http://localhost:5173` (your React app)
4. Enter your development store domain
5. Click "Connect Store" - it should redirect to Shopify OAuth
